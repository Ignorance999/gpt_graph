 _What is The Singularity?_

              The acceleration of technological progress has been the central
         feature of this century. I argue in this paper that we are on the edge
         of change comparable to the rise of human life on Earth. The precise
         cause of this change is the imminent creation by technology of
         entities with greater than human intelligence. There are several means
         by which science may achieve this breakthrough (and this is another
         reason for having confidence that the event will occur):
            o The development of computers that are "awake" and
              superhumanly intelligent. (To date, most controversy in the
              area of AI relates to whether we can create human equivalence
              in a machine. But if the answer is "yes, we can", then there
              is little doubt that beings more intelligent can be constructed
              shortly thereafter.
            o Large computer networks (and their associated users) may "wake
              up" as a superhumanly intelligent entity.
            o Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users
              may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.
            o Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural
              human intellect.

              The first three possibilities depend in large part on 
         improvements in computer hardware. Progress in computer hardware has
         followed an amazingly steady curve in the last few decades [16]. Based
         largely on this trend, I believe that the creation of greater than
         human intelligence will occur during the next thirty years.  (Charles
         Platt [19] has pointed out the AI enthusiasts have been making claims
         like this for the last thirty years. Just so I'm not guilty of a
         relative-time ambiguity, let me more specific: I'll be surprised if
         this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030.)

              What are the consequences of this event? When greater-than-human
         intelligence drives progress, that progress will be much more rapid.
         In fact, there seems no reason why progress itself would not involve
         the creation of still more intelligent entities -- on a still-shorter
         time scale. The best analogy that I see is with the evolutionary past:
         Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster
         than natural selection can do its work -- the world acts as its own
         simulator in the case of natural selection. We humans have the ability
         to internalize the world and conduct "what if's" in our heads; we can
         solve many problems thousands of times faster than natural selection.
         Now, by creating the means to execute those simulations at much higher
         speeds, we are entering a regime as radically different from our human
         past as we humans are from the lower animals.
